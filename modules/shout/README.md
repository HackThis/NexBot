# Shout

Returns an image from the config file (See data/shouts.json). Shouts can be directed at users and used inside a sentence.  

Shouts can be added, whilst the bot is running, providing the user is in the admin list (See data/config.js).  

A list of shouts can be generated by PMing the bot with the command ```shout list```
